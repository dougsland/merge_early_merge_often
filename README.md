## Introduction
"**Merge early, merge often**" is a software development philosophy, often attributed to Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel. This approach emphasizes integrating code changes frequently and early in the development process rather than waiting for large or infrequent merges.

## Merge Early, Merge Often Philosophy

### Merge Early
Developers should merge their changes into the main codebase as soon as they have completed a piece of work. This ensures that changes are integrated while they are still small, easier to review, and before they drift too far from the main codebase.

### Merge Often
Regular and frequent merging keeps the codebase up-to-date with contributions from multiple developers. It helps prevent large, complex merges that can introduce conflicts or bugs.

## Benefits of Merging Early and Often

### Reduced Merge Conflicts
Smaller, more frequent merges are less likely to result in significant conflicts.

### Continuous Integration
It encourages continuous testing and integration of changes, improving code stability and quality.

### Faster Feedback Loop
Developers can identify issues with their changes early, leading to quicker fixes.

## Main Branch Stability Concerns
Will it mean the possibility that some code in the main branch could be broken (not in stable tags or branches)?

**Yes**, merging early and often can increase the chance that code in the main branch may occasionally be unstable or broken. However, this is typically managed with additional practices in modern software development, such as:

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Frequent automated testing ensures that as soon as changes are merged, tests are run to catch issues early. While not foolproof, CI can help prevent most broken code from reaching the main branch.

### Development and Stable Branches
Some projects use separate branches, like `develop` for active development and `main` or `master` for stable releases. Merges to the stable branch only occur after thorough testing, ensuring stability for releases.

### Feature Branches
Developers work on feature branches and only merge into the main branch once features are ready and tested. This isolates experimental or unfinished code from the main branch.

### Stable Tags
Even if the main branch experiences instability, stable tags mark specific, well-tested commits that are known to be stable. Users or teams depending on production-quality code can rely on these tags instead of the latest main branch.

## Conclusion
In short, while "merge early, merge often" increases the frequency of changes and could introduce temporary instability in the main branch, good practices such as CI, feature branching, and stable tagging can minimize the impact on overall project stability.
